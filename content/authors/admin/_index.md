#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a System Engineering & Engineering Management student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong with a passion for problem-solving, algorithms design & analysis, and software development. I enjoy working on diverse side projects, including full-stack web development, mini-games, in-memory storage systems, etc. Outside of projects and uni, I would engages in learning and self-improvement through study programs, personal projects, as well as competitive programming, mastering new technologies and solving challenging problems.
