Weathering With Me aims at providing users easy access to weather information in different locations. Authenticated users would be able to search for locations, leave comments on them, as well as maintaining a set of their favorite locations. We have made use of React and Tailwind CSS in developing the frontend, while Next.js on top of Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose have been used to maintain the backend. APIs including Google Maps and WeatherAPI.com has been utilized to retrieve location and weather information.
