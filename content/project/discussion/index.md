disCUssion is a simple real-time chatting application that aims to provide (mainly) CU students with a platform to find each other by name or email (or even SID if you signed up with your CUHK email, which is highly recommended). Asking another person for a phone number can be rather uncomfortable for some people in certain situations, as the intention can be misunderstood. With just their disCUssion name or SID, you can quickly contact them and get a group chat started with other people.
